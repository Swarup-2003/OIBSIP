       <div class="Overview_Writing"> <p>The Gemera combines the exciting
            performance characteristics of a mid-engine
            two-seater megacar with the practicalities of
            a full four-seater car with more luggage
            space.
            <br><br>
            This ground-breaking combination means
            that the Koenigsegg megacar experience can
            now be shared with family and friends.</p>

                <h3>SPACE FOR FOUR</h3>
                <P>The Gemera seats four tall adults comfortably with space catering to their carry-on luggage; there is space for four carry-on suitcases in the back. 
                        <br><br>
                    The essence of the megacar is obvious in the exterior, but the fact that itâ€™s a four-seater is a complete surprise when the doors swing open. This is the Koenigsegg megacar experience that can be shared with family and friends on a never-before-seen scale.</P>

            <h3>CREATURE COMFORT</h3>
            <P>As far as creature comforts are concerned, no shortcuts were taken. You get perfectly padded memory foam seats, eight cup holders - four heated and four cooled, entertainment screens with Apple CarPlay for both the front and rear passengers, and the ever-necessary induction and USB charging ports. The 11-speaker sound system is out of this world.</P>
